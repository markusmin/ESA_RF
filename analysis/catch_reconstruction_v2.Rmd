### Description
This R markdown file will go through the catch reconstruction of yelloweye rockfish and bocaccio catch in Puget Sound. This document will generate different plausible catch scenarios and address the uncertainty at each step of the analysis. This analysis will go in reverse chronological order and go through commercial catch first and then recreational catch.. For more notes on the catch reconstruction, please see "catch_reconstruction.Rmd" in the same "analysis" folder.

Additionally, in accordance with the [2017 Rockfish Recovery Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/yelloweye-rockfish-and-bocaccio-recovery-plan), catches for three different geographic areas will be constructed:
1. The entire DPS (Canada and United States), minus the Hood Canal population
2. The Hood Canal population
3. The United States side of the DPS, excluding Hood Canal

# Commercial data

### First step: Load species composition data from Cyreis Schmitt
The first step in our analysis is to load the species composition tables from Cyreis Schmitt, as this data will be used for multiple time periods in the commercial catch.

## 2004-2020

#### Notes:
This data period is characterized by 1) low catches of bocaccio and yelloweye following regulatory changes and 2) relatively high confidence in the data.

#### Catch areas:
This data is split by region into the marine fish-shellfish marine catch reporting areas (WDFW). Areas in relation to DPSs:
1. Hood Canal: Regions 27A, 27B, and 27C. Note that Rickey's management region of "Hood Canal" includes area 25C in addition to these, but according to the rockfish recovery plan 25C is not part of the DPS. 27A appears to mostly be within the Hood Canal DPS, but a small section is outside.
2. U.S. DPS except Hood Canal: Everything else except areas 29 and 23C (these are West Juan de Fuca and outside of the DPS).


We are currently lacking regional resolution for this time period which should hopefully be fixed soon.

#### Yelloweye catch scenarios  
Yelloweye rockfish are a reporting category for this time period and as such will only have one catch estimate. 

#### Bocaccio catch scenarios  
Bocaccio rockfish are lumped into the "shelf rockfish" category and will have different catch scenarios (these could be amended if any species composition data comes available):

1. High catch: All "shelf rockfish" are bocaccio.
2. Medium catch: 50% of "shelf rockfish" are bocaccio.
3. Low catch: No "shelf rockfish" are bocaccio.

## 1970-2003

#### Notes:
This data was provided by Wayne Palsson. For the time period 1970-2003, catch has already been prorated to species level based on catch composition data.

#### Yelloweye catch scenarios
Yelloweye rockfish was estimated by prorating total rockfish catch based on reliable catch composition data for this time period. However, region 3 (Strait of Juan de Fuca) is about half in and half out of the DPS, as such, the different catch scenarios concern whether or not this data is included:

1. High catch: All catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.
2. Medium catch: 50% of the catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.
3. Low catch: No catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.

#### Bocaccio catch scenarios
Bocaccio was estimated by prorating total rockfish catch based on reliable catch composition data for this time period and as such will only have one catch estimate. However, region 3 (Strait of Juan de Fuca) is about half in and half out of the DPS, as such, the different catch scenarios concern whether or not this data is included:

1. High catch: All catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.
2. Medium catch: 50% of the catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.
3. Low catch: No catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.

## 1955-1969

#### Notes:
This data was provided by Wayne Palsson. For this time period, we have three categories for rockfish: "general rockfish", "red snapper", and "black rockfish". We do not have any catch composition data for this time period.

There are two main decisions to make regarding this time period:
1) Are yelloweye catches for this time period limited to "red snapper", or is it possible that in addition to "red snapper" there are actually yelloweye in the "general rockfish" category?
2) Should catches from the Strait of Juan de Fuca be included?

For now, we will assume that yelloweye catch is only the "red snapper" catch. Bocaccio catch will be prorated based on the 1970-1987 catch composition data from Schmitt 1991.

We also have "red snapper" already from the HISCOM data, so we just need to re-subset that dataframe for the appropriate timeframe.
 Another interesting note: West Juan de Fuca (region 7) was not used until 1970. Does this mean that there was no catch from this region until 1970 when it abruptly started, or was this due to a change in regional reporting requirements? i.e. were Strait of Juan de Fuca and West Juan de Fuca one region prior to 1970?

#### Yelloweye catch scenarios
Region 3 (Strait of Juan de Fuca) is about half in and half out of the DPS, as such, the different catch scenarios concern whether or not this data is included:

1. High catch: All "red snapper" catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.
2. Medium catch: 50% of the "red snapper" catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.
3. Low catch: No "red snapper" catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.

#### Bocaccio catch scenarios
For the time period 1955-1969, for the Strait of Juan de Fuca (region 3), there are only the following gear types: All troll, Drag seine, Bottom trawl, Set net and Salmon net. According to the species composition table from Cyreis Schmitt, none of these gear types ever caught Bocaccio in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Thus the catch of Bocaccio will not be affected by how much of the Strait of Juan de Fuca catch is included in the catch estimates.

Therefore, there is only one estimate of Bocaccio from this time period.

## 1943-1954

### Notes:
This data comes from the yellow book. We do not have any region-specific information for this time period, but we do have catches by gear.

The main decision for this time period is how to estimate the catch by region. While the yellow book does not have regional information, the bound volume data does. The bound volume catch estimates are very similar to those of the yellow book, especially for the later period (1955 onwards). At that point, should we just use the bound volume data, instead of using the yellow book for total catch and gear type and bound volume data to estimate regional proportions?

We will first compare yellow book and bound volume data for this time period.
- Based on a visual comparison of yellow book and bound volume data for 1955-1960, all regions look fairly comparable except for the "Gulf - Bellingham" region, which has higher values in the yellow book.

Main decisions for this time period:

1. Do we use the catch composition data for 1970-1987 (20-40 years after this time period)? I don't see what other data we could use.
2. What gear and region information do we use?
+ Yellow book gear information, multiplied by the regional proportions from the bound volume data
+ All data from bound volumes (total catch, gear, and region)
+ Yellow book catch totals, prorated by gear and region from the bound volumes (this feels really inaccurate).
+ Bound volume data multiplied by a conversion factor that is equal to mean yellow book divided by mean bound volume catch?

#### Approach 1: Using the bound volume data as is
Gear categories in bound volume data that are missing from the species composition data: "Drag Seine", "Hook and Line", "Other", "Purse seine", "Tribal Fisheries". The biggest category of these is the "drag seine" category.

Note: With this approach, we are just calculating all of the bound volume data at the same time (including the period 1935-1942).

##### Yelloweye catch scenarios

1. High catch: All prorated catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.
2. Medium catch: 50% of the prorated catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.
3. Low catch: No prorated catch from the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included.

## 1921-1933

### Notes:
This data comes from the yellow book. We do not have any region-specific information for this time period, but we do have catches by gear. Catches from this time period are also very low compared to later stages of the time series.

The main decision for this time period is how to estimate the catch by region. I am additionally unaware of any information that would give us an indication of region-specific effort.

Main decisions for this time period:

1. How do we prorate the catches by region?
+ From the data, we know that as a proportion of total catch, certain regions increased over time and others decreased. For example, the Strait of Juan de Fuca becomes increasingly important over time.

In the absence of regional information, we will use different plausible scenarios for catch by region:

##### Effort by region
These estimates are based on a subjective estimate of proportion of effort in the late 30s/early 40s (the time period closest to this one that has regional information).

| Region | Percentage of Effort |
|-|-|
| Central Puget Sound | 35% |
| Gulf - Bellingham | 15% |
| Hood Canal | 5% |
| San Juan Islands | 10% |
| Southern Puget Sound | 30% |
| Strait of Juan de Fuca | 5% |

I will use this table to prorate catch, based on a gear + region (from the Schmitt et al. 1991 table, which is admittedly from half a century later).

##### Yelloweye catch scenarios
This time period has a huge amount of uncertainty, but also has minimal data and thus the different catch scenarios are unlikely to make much of a difference to stock status.

1. High catch: Double the prorated catch (2x estimates).
2. Medium catch: The prorated catch (1x estimates).
3. Low catch: Half of the prorated catch (0.5x estimates).

##### Bocaccio catch scenarios
This time period has a huge amount of uncertainty, but also has minimal data and thus the different catch scenarios are unlikely to make much of a difference to stock status.

1. High catch: Double the prorated catch (2x estimates).
2. Medium catch: The prorated catch (1x estimates).
3. Low catch: Half of the prorated catch (0.5x estimates).

# Recreational data

### Notes
- The recreational catch has been greater in magnitude than the commercial catch for both species for a large portion of the time series. 

### First step: load recreational conversion tables
Necessary for converting number of individuals to weight (kg or lbs)
```{r load_rec_conv_tables, cache = TRUE}
recreational_weight_conversion_path <- here("catch_reconstruction_data", "recreational", "Recreationalconversion.xls")
recreational_weight_conversion <- read_excel(recreational_weight_conversion_path, sheet = "Sheet1", skip = 1)
recreational_weight_conversion %>% 
  dplyr::rename(species = "...2") %>% 
  dplyr::select(-"...1") -> recreational_weight_conversion

# Extract values for yelloweye, bocaccio, all RF
YE_lbs_per_individual <- recreational_weight_conversion[recreational_weight_conversion$species == "Yelloweye rockfish",]$lbs
BOC_lbs_per_individual <- recreational_weight_conversion[recreational_weight_conversion$species == "Bocaccio",]$lbs
RF_lbs_per_individual <- recreational_weight_conversion[recreational_weight_conversion$species == "Misc. rockfish",]$lbs
```

### 2003-2019

#### Notes
This data was based on a creel survey of anglers. Catches are overall very low, but there are also high variances in the estimates. Yelloweye and Bocaccio catch scenarios are the same. Of additional note: there is a general rockfish category. Is it possible that some yelloweye or bocaccio are part of this category, despite them also having their own unique categories?

#### Main decisions for this time period:

1. Do we assume all released catch survived, or do we think that a portion of this value should be considered catch since many are likely to have had barotrauma and died? The main question is what proportion of discarded yelloweye or bocaccio were actually released at depth; Hochhalter and Reed (2011) estimated almost 99% survival of yelloweye rockfish released at depth, but only about 22% of yelloweye rockfish released at the surface.
2. Do we try to prorate the "general rockfish" category at all?
3. How do we combine estimates/variance from the four different "target type" categories ("other", "salmon", "bottom", "halibut").

#### Yelloweye/Bocaccio catch scenarios
Calculate catch/release/standard deviation for each target type and area individually; sum these for each year.

1. High catch: Creel estimate + one SD; 50% of estimated released rockfishes considered to be catch (died from barotrauma)
2. Medium catch: Creel estimate; 20% of estimated released rockfishes considered to be catch (died from barotrauma)
3. Low catch: Creel estimate - one SD; 5% of estimated released rockfishes considered to be catch (all released at depth, 95% survived - from Hannah et al. 2014, work done on yelloweye)

## 1994-2002

#### Notes:
From Palsson et al. 2009: 

"The foremost challenge in the last decade has been monitoring the dominant recreational fishery. Until 2004, bottomfish estimates from the WDFW recreational survey have depended upon open salmon fisheries and salmon catch record cards (Palsson 1988). This system necessitated year-round, open salmon fisheries to result in a complete estimate of bottomfish harvest by hook-and-line, boat-based fishers. Severe salmon fishery closures began in 1994 resulting in incomplete catch estimates for almost all catch areas until 2004 when a new catch estimation system was instituted."

"Beginning in 1994, large–scale closures occurred for the recreational salmon fishery, preventing successful bottomfish catch and effort estimates in many areas of Puget Sound. When an area is closed to recreational salmon fishing, there is no numerator to divide by then effort or bottomfish catch rate, preventing any point estimate of effort or bottomfish catch. Consequently, bottomfish catch and effort estimates have been severely underestimated from 1994 to 2003."

There were also major changes to the regulations regarding recreational rockfish fishing:

1. 1994: Rockfish daily bag limit reduced to five rockfish in North Sound and three in South Sound.
2. 2000: One rockfish bag limit enacted for all of Puget Sound east of Sekiu River. Emergency regulation temporarily increasing rockfish bag limit to 3 in Sekiu area to allow for black rockfish harvest.
3. 2002: May-Sept 30, west of Slip Point daily limit of 3, only 1 of which may be other than a black rockfish, permanent rule. Temporary prohibition of yelloweye and canary harvest.
4. 2003: Yelloweye and canary rockfish cannot be retained.

So how do we estimate the combined impact of under-reporting and these new regulations?

Here's another big problem: The data that I have is currently summed across "North Puget Sound" and "South Puget Sound". Hood Canal is included in "South Puget Sound". I'm sure this was summed at some point from finer resolution data, but can we find that data? We also don't know exactly how much of the Strait of Juan de Fuca is included in "North Puget Sound" - should follow up with Wayne Palsson. I also need to know why the catch is prorated into species for 1970-1985 but not 1986-2002.

- The creel survey data exists from 2003-present - not sure exactly what the one year difference is? Or perhaps the survey started in 2004, but collected data for 2003?
- Clearly the estimates from 1994 to 2002 are an underestimate - but how can we correct for this? We can use the 1994-2002 data as the minimum catch, and multiply catches by a certain factor for the medium and high catch scenarios. But by what factor do we multiply this? Perhaps we can get some information from the amount of salmon fishing effort relative to historical levels?

#### Yelloweye/Bocaccio catch scenarios
For this time period, we will prorate catches based on composition data and subsequently multiply by a factor to account for under-reporting. Will need to check in with Greg Lippert/Wayne Palsson to get their thoughts on this, since these are arbitrary values...

1. High catch: Prorated estimate x 3.
2. Medium catch: Prorated estimate x 2.
3. Low catch: Prorated estimate x 1.

For yelloweye, we also need to separate Hood Canal from the rest of the data. Looking at Palsson 1987, catch from Hood Canal looks to be about 1-3% of total catches of yelloweye. For now if we need a placeholder, I think we can safely assume that 2% of yelloweye catch is from Hood canal and it would be a fine assumption. If we're talking about South Puget Sound only, it's more like 12%. We'll use that as a placeholder until we get better data.

## 1970-1993

#### Notes
Wayne Palsson does not seem to have a high degree of confidence for the recreational catch for this time period; however, there is also no indication of how to quantitatively address this uncertainty.

Catch composition data for the recreational fishery exists for 1980-1986 and 1989 for this time period; the next compositional data is from 1996. We will use all compositional data from 1980-1986 and 1989 to prorate catches for this time period. There is also some catch composition data for 1965-1967; see PDF page 108 from Palsson et al. 2009, with the original data from Buckley (1967, 1968); Buckley and Satterthwaite (1970).

#### Yelloweye and Bocaccio catch scenarios
There is only one catch scenario for yelloweye and bocaccio.

## Pre-1970

We know that there was some recreational catch for this time period, but it was not documented.

#### Notes
In all of the Buckley documents, yelloweye rockfish is called "Rasphead rockfish". Catch statistics by area since 1965.

Wayne Palsson says this about the Buckley papers: "Early species composition observations are available for 1965 to 1967 based on expanded harvest estimates (Buckley 1967, 1968; Buckley and Satterthwaite 1970) and offer a glimpse into earlier species proportions of the rockfish harvest in North and South Puget Sound. Samplers at that time were developing their basis of species identifications and some observations may be questionable."

#### Yelloweye catch scenarios
?????? Not sure if I should try to multiply by a factor or not for different scenarios... documents do say that these should be treated as minimum estimates, but I'm not sure what a defensible conversion factor is.



##### Buckley docs (1965-1967)
Buckley (1967) - 1965 recreational bottomfish fishery:
- Distinction between "incidental" and "specific" harvests:
  - "Bottomfish caught while actively angling for salmon were incidental harvests."
  - "Bottomfish caught while actively angling for species other than salmon were specific harvests."
- "The Washington sport-angling harvest of marine bottomfish, also referred to as "nonsalmon food fish", has been considered of negligible importance in our management scheme and very little effort was expended in this direction through 1964. In early 1965, however, the recreation potential offered by bottomfish species and their future importance in the rapidly expanding Washington sport fishery prompted the inclusion of their harvest in the regular sampling of the salmon-sport fishery."
- "At present, the majority of Washington's sport anglers consider most bottomfish as "scrap fish" and the ratio of the number retained in the harvest to the number actually caught appears extremely low in all areas."
  - Possible that catch is underestimate of total fishing mortality of rockfishes, given barotrauma
- "1965 was the first year State-wide bottomfish harvests were calculated"
- "Bottomfish data were usually taken for species, but if this was not possible (perhaps due to insufficient time for positive identification) those fish in question were recorded on the family level."
  - This explains why sometimes rockfish are identified to the species level and sometimes only as "unclassified rockfish".
  - If we assume that identification was done randomly (no bias towards not identifying certain species), then we can use the comps for the identified species to identify the unidentified species


Buckley and Sattherwhaite (1970) - 1967 recreational bottomfish fishery:
- See marine area codes on page 40. Regions 6-12 are the DPS. Region 13 was not added until 1976, according to Palsson 1987 - prior to 1976, region 12 encompassed regions 12 and 13.
- "Any specific bottomfish angling in these areas in previous years was apparently at a level low enough to remain undetected at past sampling intensities. Sampling procedures and manpower levels did not change significantly in these areas in 1967, indicating a substantial increase in specific bottomfish angling."
- "The calculated total sport harvest of 276,837 bottomfish in 1967 was a 15% increase over the 1966 catch of 250,483 fish, the only other year for which state-wide figures are available."
- "Rockfish were the dominant family, contributing more than 54% of the total incidental harvest."
- "Rockfish were the dominant family, accounting for more than 43% of the total specific harvest."


#### Bargmann tables (1968-1973)
- Use years 1968 and 1969. Data is available in Google Drive here (old fishery records and analysis): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/0B3NnRv_9_F9sNG1ITG1fQU5ZUFk/edit#gid=1104389180
- "The data used in this report were gathered by technicians collecting data primarily for the sport salmon fishery, and data on marine fish catches were recorded secondarily. As such, there were many gaps and areas of incomplete coverage in the bottomfish harvest estimates. The reader is cautioned that **the estimates presented here should be regarded as minimum harvest estimates**.


##### WDFW Annual Bulletins

These are all available online through the University of Washington library.

1940 report:
- "Approximately 60% of the resorts reported regularly on a purely voluntary basis... It should be noted that all individual catches brought in to any given resort cannot be recorded by the manager. For that reason the catch statistics given below can be assumed to constitute only a very conservative record of the number of fish caught by recreational fishermen fishing from the various resorts."
- "In estimating the total sports catch of any species for 1940, allowance must be made for (a) 43% of known boathouses not reporting during the eight-months period above, (b) four additional months to complete the year, and (c) catches made by persons not using boathouse facilities.
  - Tables indicate the in each year, somewhere between 30% and 60% of total known boathouses are reporting.
- "While statistics of sports catches kept by the Department of Fisheries on the present basis provide the basis of reasonable estimates, **the data are by no means complete or accurate**." 

Note: Annual bulletins started in 1935, but 1935-1937 had no note of sport fishing statistics. Reporting by boathouses dropped dramatically in 1942, and then in 1943 it appears that the Department of Fisheries stopped surveying boathouses altogether.

A quote from page 11 of the 1946 annual bulletin:

"The Puget Sound salmon investigation was extended in 1946 to include a study of the magnitude of the sport fishery. **A similar study had been carried on for several years before the war** and had demonstrated the necessity for determining the number of fish which is taken each year by Puget Sound sportsmen. Daily catch report blanks were distributed to boathouse operators throughout the Puget Sound area and sport-catch statistics were received from more than one half of the boathouses contacted."
- So clearly there was a sport fishery, but they seem to have stopped monitoring it during the war and didn't pick it up again.

From page 27 of the 1948 annual bulletin (this is about the recreational salmon fishery):

"The sport fishery, however, has increased in popularity in recent years and the number of fishermen has increased tremendously. New areas have become popular. In 1939 there were 231,000 fishermen days, while in 1947 there were 343,000, or an increase of 100,000 in eight years. These figures, moreover, merely represent just those persons that fished from rented boats, and **no estimate is attempted of trips made in private boats**. At the present the Department of Fisheries has no check or record of private boat fishing, but in 1949 a survey will be made of this fishing for the first time."
- Increased recreational effort, and these statistics are an underestimate (these surveys only of boathouses).

Page 43 of the 1949 report: 
"Surveys of the number fishermen using **Puget Sound** have been made by the department since 1938 but never such scale 1949 when evaluation of private fishing parties was attempted along with the usual boathouse count . It is calculated that a minimum of 684,814 fisherman trips occurred, compared with the previous high of 343,000 in 1947. There are about 150 boathouses renting 4,000 small fishing craft on the Sound . Another 2,000 private boats are moored at the boathouses exclusive of public moorage facilities. A total of 15,000 outboard motorboats is registered with the coast guard . Boat counts in the sports fishing areas showed an average of about 30 private craft for every 100 rented boats during the busiest part of the 1949 season . The average in the winter months, from November through February, was about 7 for every 100. In arriving at the total number of fishermen , boathouse catches were increased in these proportions to allow for fish landed by private boats . During the winter , as many as 100 fishermen a day fished from Seattle docks . Their take of salmon , often as great as that of the boat fishermen , also is included in the sports total."
- They stopped monitoring the bottomfish fishery it seems, but there are at least records of fisherman trips/fishermen days.
- I think a reasonable estimate would be a ramp up from the original estimates in 1938 through when we have data starting in 1965? Not sure what sort of ramp though.
  - Constant ramp of +25,000 fishermen days/year would get reasonably close to 1965 values
  - Annual growth rate of 4-5% also is fairly good

Page 66 of the 1962 report (of the recreational salmon fishery):
For all of Washington: "The estimated number of angler trips was a new record jumping to 1,130,800, an increase of nearly 100,000 over the previous high set in 1961."
"The total catch in Puget Sound of 193,200 salmon, was not large when compared to the corresponding 778,800 angler trips".
  - This would not represent a big ramp up from 1949 (684,814).
  
  
Page 16-D of the 1965 report:
"A calculated 34,196 angler trips were expended in noncoastal marine areas for bottomfish only in 1965, approximately 3.4% of the 1965 food fish angling effort for these waters."
- This same information is in the Buckley (1967) report on the 1965 bottomfish sport fishery.

Page 16-A of the 1965 report has angler trips by area
- "The 1,278,000 angler trips expended... were only below the 1,432,000 trips recorded for 1963".
- 1,278,000 total in Washington
- 125,000 in Ilwaco, 170,000 in Westport, 22,000 in LaPush, 46,000 in Neah Bay (I believe these are the coastal marine waters), then 98,000 in Sekiu-Pillar Point.

**Information on Boathouses**

https://www.cwb.org/fish-on

Maybe 15% of boathouses in 1957 were in Hood Canal, 15% North of Admiralty Inlet, and the other 70% in "South Puget Sound" (south of Admiralty)

Here we will recalculate the Buckley species compositions so that we can get comps on a finer scale than "North Puget Sound" and "South Puget Sound".

South Puget Sound = areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
Hood Canal = area 12
North Puget Sound = areas 5, 6, 7

### 1938-1942 WDFW Annual Bulletins


#### Yelloweye catch scenarios
Main questions here are 1) how to deal with prorating rockfish category if there is also a "red snapper" category and 2) what species proportions to use
1. High catch scenario: In years where "red snapper" is listed, 2% of the other rockfish catch is red snapper. In years where no red snapper is listed (1938 and 1939), 4% of the rockfish catch is red snapper.
2. Medium catch scenario: In years where "red snapper" is listed, 1% of the other rockfish catch is red snapper. In years where no red snapper is listed (1938 and 1939), 2% of the rockfish catch is red snapper.
3. Low catch scenario: In years where "red snapper" is listed, it is the only yelloweye catch. In years where no red snapper is listed (1938 and 1939), prorate catch based on mean proportion of total rockfishes that are "red snapper" from the years 1940-42.

#### Bocaccio catch scenarios
Question for bocaccio is how to prorate the general rockfishes category
1. High catch scenario: 2% of the rockfish catch is bocaccio
2. Medium catch scenario: 1% of the rockfish catch is bocaccio
3. Low catch scenario: No bocaccio were caught (0%)

```

How to estimate private boat (non-boathouse) effort? The best indication we have is from the 1949 annual report (which is the first time that they tried to estimate private effort in the recreational (salmon) fishery):

"Boat counts in the sports fishing areas showed an average of about 30 private craft for every 100 rented boats during the busiest part of the 1949 season . The average in the winter months, from November through February, was about 7 for every 100."

Based on a plot of fisherman days per boathouse by month, the peak month is August. So to get from 7 in February to 30 in August, the growth rate is 1.2744. To get from 30 in August to 7 in November, the growth rate is 0.6156.

```{r est_private_effort}
# Calculate multipliers of boathouse fisherman days
private_boats <- data.frame(month = c("February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November"), multiplier = rep(0, 10))
# Add value February
# private_boats[private_boats$month %in% c("February", "November"),]$multiplier <- 7
private_boats[private_boats$month == "February",]$multiplier <- 7

for (i in 2:7){

## 1943-1964: Use information from Buckley and 1938-1942 WDFW annual bulletins

Here we are estimating proportions of the rock_cod catch that we think is yelloweye or bocaccio.
1. Question 1: Do we think that for years where "red snapper" was recorded, there is still some yelloweye in the "rock cod" catch?
  -I think that the most likely case is that some boathouses did record all yelloweye as "red snapper", while other boathouses didn't make the distinction at all, since these catch records were all voluntarily filled out and submitted. Great!
  - We can say that 50% of boathouses reported red snapper catch separately and 50% didn't, so we can multiply the proportion by 0.5.
2. Question 2: What catch proportions are reasonable to use? The 1965-1967 Buckley values?
  - These are the closest recorded catch compositions temporally, but obviously they're not great...
3. Where do we think that the boathouses are? Hopefully we can get some more information from the Center for Wooden Boats... But for now our best guess is: 
  - Maybe 15% of boathouses in 1957 were in Hood Canal, 15% North of Admiralty Inlet, and the other 70% in "South Puget Sound" (south of Admiralty).
  - At a finer scale: 
  - Based on this map: https://cwbblog.wordpress.com/2012/12/18/new-exhibit-fish-on-opening-at-the-center-for-wooden-boats-december-29th-explores-the-history-of-boathouses-and-fishing-resorts-of-puget-sound/
  
Okay, let's divide effort by area by # of boathouses (approx - based on map, looks to be about 135 boathouses in Puget Sound)
- Area 6: 4% (~5 boathouses)
- Area 7: 10% (~13 boathouses)
- Area 8: 18% (~25 boathouses)
- Area 9: 22% (~30 boathouses)
- Area 10: 15% (~20 boathouses)
- Area 11: 15% (~20 boathouses)
- Area 12:  16% (~22 boathouses)


#### Yelloweye and Bocaccio catch scenarios
1. High catch scenario: Use max annual Buckley (1965-1967) catch proportions
  - The issue with this is that there are some crazy high proportions - e.g. 22% of rockfish catch in Hood canal in 1965 was yelloweye. That leads to some ridiculously high values in the high catch scenario.
  - Maybe instead we should use the 1970-1987 proportions? These values look to be more like 1% of total rockfish catch, which would lead to values more in line with the later catches.
2. Medium catch scenario: Use mean Buckley (1965-1967) catch proportions
3. Low catch scenario: Use min annual Buckley (1965-1967) catch proportions
